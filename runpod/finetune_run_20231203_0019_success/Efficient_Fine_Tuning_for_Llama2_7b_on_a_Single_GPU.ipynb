      "### instruction: what are the genetic changes related to sialuria ?\n",
      "### response: mutations in the sial gene cause sialuria. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sialidase. this enzyme is found in the lysosomes of cells. lysosomes are compartments within cells that digest and recycle materials. sialidase breaks down certain types of molecules called sialic acids. these molecules are found in the outer membrane of cells and in the extracellular matrix, which is a network of proteins and other molecules that supports and surrounds cells.  sialidase is important for the normal development and function of many tissues and organs. it is particularly important for the development of the nervous system and the function of the brain. this enzyme is also involved in the development of the kidneys and the liver.  mutations in the sial gene lead to a deficiency of sialidase. this deficiency prevents the breakdown of sialic acids, which can accumulate in cells and tissues. the accumulation of sialic acids in the lysosomes of cells is thought to be the cause of the signs and symptoms of sialuria.\n",

      "### response: coffin-lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, and distinctive facial features. the signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely among affected individuals. some people with coffin-lowry syndrome have mild intellectual disability and short stature, while others have severe intellectual disability and short stature. some people with this condition have distinctive facial features, including a broad forehead, a prominent nose, and a small chin. others have no facial abnormalities. some people with coffin-lowry syndrome have a small head size (microcephaly) and a small mouth (micrognathia). some people with this condition have a heart defect called atrial septal defect (asd).  the signs and symptoms of coffin-lowry syndrome are caused by mutations in the sall4 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation of many different types of cells. the sall4 protein is particularly important for the development of cells in the brain and spinal cord (neural crest cells). it is unclear how mutations in the sall4 gene lead to the signs and symptoms of coffin-lowry syndrome.\n",

      "### instruction: what are the genetic changes related to hereditary hemochromatosis ?\n",
      "### response: mutations in the hfe gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called transferrin receptor 2. transferrin receptor 2 is found in the membrane of cells that line the digestive tract and in cells in the liver. the protein helps transport iron from the digestive tract to the liver.  mutations in the hfe gene lead to the production of a transferrin receptor 2 protein that is defective or missing. the protein is unable to transport iron from the digestive tract to the liver. as a result, iron builds up in the liver and other organs. the excess iron is toxic to cells and can damage tissues and organs.  the hfe gene mutations that cause hereditary hemochromatosis are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. autosomal recessive inheritance means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n",

      "### instruction: what are the genetic changes related to alpha-mannosidosis ?\n",
      "### response: mutations in the mannose 6-phosphate receptor 1 (mr1) gene cause alpha-mannosidosis. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the lysosomes of cells. lysosomes are compartments that digest and recycle many types of molecules. the mr1 protein is involved in the transport of mannose 6-phosphate, a sugar molecule that is used to label certain molecules for digestion in the lysosomes. the mr1 protein also plays a role in the development of the nervous system.  mutations in the mr1 gene lead to the production of an abnormally short mr1 protein that is unable to transport mannose 6-phosphate. as a result, mannose 6-phosphate is not labeled for digestion in the lysosomes. the lack of mannose 6-phosphate labeling prevents the digestion of certain molecules, including glycoproteins, which are proteins that have sugar molecules attached to them. the accumulation of these molecules in the brain and other tissues causes the signs and symptoms of alpha-mannosidosis.\n",

      "### instruction: what are the genetic changes related to episodic ataxia ?\n",
      "### response: episodic ataxia is caused by mutations in the scn4a gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the brain and spinal cord. the scn4a protein is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in cells. it is thought to play a role in the development of the nervous system and in the maintenance of normal brain function.  the scn4a gene mutations that cause episodic ataxia are thought to disrupt the function of the scn4a protein. it is unclear how the mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of this disorder. it is possible that the mutations cause the protein to be less stable and more likely to break down (be degraded) than normal. it is also possible that the mutations alter the protein's ability to regulate calcium levels in cells. these changes may lead to the abnormal brain activity that is characteristic of episodic ataxia.\n",
