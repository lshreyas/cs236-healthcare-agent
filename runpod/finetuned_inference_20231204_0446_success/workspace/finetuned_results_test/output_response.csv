"the prognosis for individuals with gaucher disease depends on the type of the disease. the most severe form, type 3, is usually fatal in infancy. type 1 is a chronic, progressive disease that can be controlled with enzyme replacement therapy. type 2 is a milder form of the disease that is usually controlled with enzyme replacement therapy."
"amish lethal microcephaly is a rare genetic disorder that causes severe intellectual disability and a small head size (microcephaly). the signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or within the first few months of life. affected individuals may have seizures, feeding difficulties, and problems with movement and coordination (ataxia). they may also have distinctive facial features, including a small head, a prominent forehead, a small chin, and a narrow nasal bridge. some affected individuals have a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia, which is characterized by a small cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls movement and coordination).  amish lethal microcephaly is caused by changes (mutations) in the ptpn11 gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of the brain and nervous system. the ptpn11 protein is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and division (proliferation). it is thought to play a role in the development of the cerebellum and other parts of the brain.  the ptpn11 gene mutations that cause amish lethal microcephaly are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. in most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. in some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an unaffected parent."
"this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in many cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

"mutations in the tau gene cause adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia. the tau gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in nerve cells (neurons) throughout the brain and spinal cord. this protein is involved in the transport of cellular components within neurons. it also plays a role in the formation of the cell's internal skeleton (cytoskeleton) and in the development of the cell's extensions (axons).  mutations in the tau gene lead to the production of an abnormal protein that is toxic to neurons. the abnormal protein is thought to damage the cytoskeleton and impair the transport of cellular components. as a result, the axons of neurons are damaged and the neurons die. the death of neurons in the brain and spinal cord leads to the signs and symptoms of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia."

"mutations in the brca1 and brca2 genes are the most common genetic changes related to breast cancer. these genes provide instructions for making proteins that help repair damaged dna. when a damaged dna segment is repaired, the cell uses the information in the dna to make the protein that is needed.  mutations in the brca1 and brca2 genes impair the ability of these proteins to repair damaged dna. as a result, cells are more likely to develop mutations that can lead to cancer.  mutations in other genes have also been found to increase the risk of breast cancer. these genes include pten, p16, and tp53.  mutations in these genes are thought to increase the risk of breast cancer by impairing the ability of cells to repair damaged dna. however, it is unclear how these mutations increase the risk of breast cancer."

"familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy is a rare condition that causes the body to produce too much uric acid. uric acid is a chemical that is normally produced when the body breaks down purines, which are chemicals found in the body and in certain foods. uric acid is normally removed from the body in the urine.  in people with familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, the kidneys are unable to remove enough uric acid from the blood. as a result, uric acid crystals form in the kidneys and cause inflammation and damage to the kidneys. this damage can lead to kidney failure.  familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

"a stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. brain cells die because they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood. within minutes, an area of the brain becomes damaged or dies.
                
stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the united states. each year, about 795,000 people have a stroke. about 610,000 of these are first attacks, and about 185,000 are recurrent attacks.
                
stroke is the third leading cause of death in the united states. each year, about 130,000 people die from stroke.
                
stroke is a medical emergency. prompt treatment is crucial.
                
the two main types of stroke are ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.
                
ischemic stroke
                
ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. it is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. the clot may block the entire vessel or may obstruct only part of it.
                
the blocked blood vessel prevents oxygen-rich blood from getting to the brain. brain cells begin to die within minutes. if the blood flow is not restored, the stroke will cause permanent brain damage.
                
hemorrhagic stroke
                
hemorrhagic stroke is less common than ischemic stroke. it is caused by a blood vessel in the brain that ruptures or leaks. the ruptured or leaking blood vessel prevents oxygen-rich blood from getting to the brain. brain cells begin to die within minutes. if the blood flow is not restored, the stroke will cause permanent brain damage.
                
the two main types of hemorrhagic stroke are intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
                
intracerebral hemorrhage
                
intracerebral hemorrhage is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. it occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or leaks. the ruptured or leaking blood vessel prevents oxygen-rich blood from getting to the brain. brain cells begin to die within minutes. if the blood flow is not restored, the stroke will cause permanent brain damage.
                
subarachnoid hemorrhage
                
subarachnoid hemorrhage is the second most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. it occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or leaks. the ruptured or leaking blood vessel prevents oxygen-rich blood from getting to the brain. brain cells begin to die within minutes. if the blood flow is not restored, the stroke will cause permanent brain damage.

"mutations in the cats gene cause carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. the enzyme is also involved in the transport of carnitine across the mitochondrial membrane. carnitine is a compound that helps transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are broken down to produce energy.  mutations in the cats gene result in a shortage of functional enzyme. the shortage of enzyme impairs the transport of long-chain fatty acids and carnitine across the mitochondrial membrane. as a result, the body cannot use fatty acids for energy. the shortage of enzyme also impairs the transport of carnitine across the mitochondrial membrane, which prevents the body from using carnitine to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria."

"renal tubular acidosis (rta) is a condition in which the kidneys cannot properly remove acid from the blood. the kidneys normally remove acid from the blood by filtering it out of the blood and into the urine. in rta, the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the blood. as a result, the blood becomes too acidic.  there are several types of rta. the most common type is called distal renal tubular acidosis. this type is caused by a problem with the kidneys' ability to remove acid from the blood. the second most common type is called proximal renal tubular acidosis. this type is caused by a problem with the kidneys' ability to absorb acid from the blood.  rta can be inherited or acquired. inherited rta is caused by changes (mutations) in the genes that provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the removal of acid from the blood. acquired rta is caused by other conditions, such as kidney disease, liver disease, or diabetes.  the signs and symptoms of rta vary depending on the type. in some cases, the condition is mild and does not cause any symptoms. in other cases, the condition can be severe and cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  rta can be diagnosed with a blood test that measures the amount of acid in the blood. treatment depends on the type of rta and the severity of the condition."
