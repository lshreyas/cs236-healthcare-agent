As a health agent, I can provide information on potential interactions between Stevia and other medications.

Stevia can increase blood pressure and heart rate, which may negatively affect people taking these medications.

Today, Stanford is one of the top universities globally, known for its academic excellence and groundbreaking research.\\n\\nWould you like to know more about Palo Alto or anything else?\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["10%5"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KtyA4aLgtVGa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700250137326,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Lakhtakia","userId":"06330471641543911757"}},"outputId":"bff1c9ed-17b6-43ab-adc6-66edb473aeca"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":64}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pd.DataFrame(\n","    {'resp': med_responses}\n",")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":112},"id":"1ALoH9tWzf2B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700250543834,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Lakhtakia","userId":"06330471641543911757"}},"outputId":"993b3f15-1e2a-4bdf-94ef-591bd549733a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                resp\n","0  Thank you for providing more information.
